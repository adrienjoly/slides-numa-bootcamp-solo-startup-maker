Synopsis:

- This is the story of my latest freelance project for a startup company.
- I explain why:
  - I chose Meteor to do it,
  - how fast it works,
  - how I convinced by client to use the Agile methodology
  - and how I applied it as a solo developer on their ambitious startup product.

# .white-on-black[ Agile for solo developer? ]

???

Oui, car utiliser une méthode agile permet de:

- maintenir un backlog
- développer le produit étape par étape
- découper les fonctionnalités en petites taches (user story cards)
- forcer l'estimation/chiffrage de chaque tache => décision possible
- retrospective: améliorer le process à chaque fin de sprint

# ![ Meteor ](./img/meteor-logo.png)

- Since 2012, free and open-source
- **RoR-inspired** framework for rapid application development
- **Universal Javascript**: same language on front-end and back-end
- Make **web and mobile** apps from the same codebase
- **Reactive**/real-time rendering
- **Modern stack**: Node.js, MongoDB, React or Angular
- 9900+ Full-stack packages => **productivity**
