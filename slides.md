Synopsis:

- This is the story of my latest freelance project for a startup company.

  - how fast it works,
  - how I convinced by client to use the Agile methodology
  - and how I applied it as a solo developer on their ambitious startup product.

# .white-on-black[ Agile for solo developer? ]

???

Oui, car utiliser une méthode agile permet de:

- maintenir un backlog
- développer le produit étape par étape
- découper les fonctionnalités en petites taches (user story cards)
- forcer l'estimation/chiffrage de chaque tache => décision possible
- retrospective: améliorer le process à chaque fin de sprint
